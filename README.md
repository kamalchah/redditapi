# Reddit API Project
This project makes use of the reddit API wrapper PRAW and pythons Tkinter library as a frontend presentation to choose which data you want to see.
Using the reddit API, we can observe data such as subreddits posts', their authors username, karma, comments on the post and much more.

To try this out for yourself, you need to download 2 python files, tkgui and RedditPraw and replace all the information for authentication in the RedditPraw.py file with your own. To get a client id and secret, go to reddit.com/prefs/apps and for user agent, any random key will do.
